Description: This reduced piecewise exponential survival software implements the likelihood ratio test procedure in Han, Schell, and Kim (2009). Inputs to the program can be either times when events/censoring occur or the vectors of total time on test and the number of events. Outputs of the programs are times of events and the corresponding p- values. The order of times and p-values is determined by a backward elimination procedure. Details about the model and implementation are given in Han, Schell, and Kim (2009). This program can run in R version 12 and above.
